dsctl - Directory Service control

This tool is a command line interface aimed to interact with the DSD service (Directory Service Daemon).
At the present moment, all the logic is written into one file, dsctl.py. In a near future, a library
called libdsm must be written in an attempt to completely abstract the directory service message protocol
that is used by dsctl.py. The tool dsctl will then import the libdsm and interact with it.

libdsm is going to be the basic building block in the effort of building a web based administration system
or any other system written in python that have to interact with DSD.

What has to be done:

	- A lot of clean up ! this is just a proof of concept at this point.

	- breaking down dsctl.py into libdsm.py and dsctl.py
